- 👋 Hi, I’m @kj-weber , Kenneth J Weber, a Control Systems Engineer for General Motors Innovation, with (mostly) software engineer day to day responsibilities. 
- 💼 Currently, I lead teams of 2-4 engineers and developers in two AGILE(scrum) projects. I have completed 4 multi-year Innovation projects which have all made it onto major vehicle programs impacting a total of approximately *6 million* vehicles launching across 2020-2028! 
- 👀 I’m interested in image processing / computer vision in python and c++ (check out my paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9649791 ). Recently, I've begun learning backend web app design via python django.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web design, after 6 years of studying vision and artificial intelligence.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web applications and start up ideas, or in new career opportunities.
