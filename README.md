- 👋 Hi, I’m @kj-weber , Kenneth J Weber, a Control Systems Engineer at General Motors Innovation, with (mostly) software engineer day to day responsibilities. 
- 💼 Currently, I autonomously manage two teams of 4 engineers, and also lead develop on these seaparate AGILE(scrum) projects, which are creating monocular camera-based perception features. Within GM, I've already completed 4 multi-year Innovation projects which have all made it onto major vehicle programs impacting a total of approximately *6 million vehicles* launching across 2020-2028, most with zero added cost! 
- 👀 I’m interested and specialize in creating robust image processing & computer vision solutions in python and c++. 
Check out my undergraduate IEEE paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9649791 , I've learned much in the 3 years since! 
- 🐸☕️ I have seen that solutions created through a robotics-based approach coupled with a good representation of the world around the camera (classical computer vision and bayesian statistics) can outperform even the most modern machine learning-based perception solutions, but I have worked to design and implement both and even hybrid solutions in the industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web design, but continue to read literature on vision and artificial intelligence after 6 years of studying.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with and learn more from those experienced with web app development, I'm looking to lead larger software teams, solve difficult perception problems, pursue start up ideas, or new career opportunities.
