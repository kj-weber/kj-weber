- 👋 Hi, I’m @kj-weber , Kenneth J Weber, a Control Systems Engineer at General Motors Innovation, with (mostly) software engineer day to day responsibilities. 
- 💼 Currently, I manage & lead develop two AGILE(scrum) projects, which are creating perception features, consisting of 2 & 4 engineers. I have completed 4 multi-year Innovation projects which have all made it onto major vehicle programs impacting a total of approximately *6 million* vehicles launching across 2020-2028! 
- 👀 I’m interested and specialize in creating robust image processing & computer vision solutions in python and c++ 
(check out my undergraduate IEEE paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9649791 ). 
- 🐸☕️ I have seen that solutions created through a robotics - based approach coupled with a good representation of the world around the camera (classical computer vision and bayesian statistics) can outperform machine learning - based perception solutions, but I have worked with both and even hybrid solutions in the industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web design, but continue to read literature on vision and artificial intelligence after 6 years of studying.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with and learn more from those experienced with web applications development, looking to lead larger software teams, solve difficult perception problems, pursue start up ideas, or new career opportunities.
- 📫 You can reach me @ kj.weber@yahoo.ca
